# Projeto OÃ¡sis

This project is a playground in which would be great to try a lot of new nice technologies...

Something about it:

* Ruby version
  * 2.4.1

* System dependencies
  * Redis

* Configuration
  * Convention for now

* Database creation
  * `rails db:create`, but I recommend the next point...

* Database initialization
  * `rails db:setup` is supposed to do all you need

* How to run the test suite
  * `rspec`

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
  * Maybe in the future...

* Deployment instructions
  * Soon..
